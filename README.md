# expense-tracker

### Project Information

This project contains a one page, front-end only expense tracker made in order to meet the requirements of a take home assignment for a job I applied to. 

Data persistence is achieved through localStorage (not the most elegant of solutions but one that was easy to deliver in a short time frame). 

Vue.js is the front-end framework used. 

List of libraries used can be deduced used the package.json file.

Further optimisations certainly possible and will be worked on as this app is integrated into my personal blog.

You can access the app at http://18.139.205.206/ (do not use https! Site security has not been attended to, yet).

For an impressive demo, consider using the random expense generator and generate 100 expenses. The random expense generator accepts a few parameters and generates random expenses. The charts are most interesting if there is appreciable volume of data.
